# README: RobotFramework Project with Browser and Faker Libraries

## About the Project

I created this project to demonstrate how the **Browser** and **Faker** libraries can be used in the **Robot Framework** for automation. The primary test case focuses on automating account creation on the **Luma Web App**, showing how Faker generates realistic data (like names, passwords, and emails) and how the Browser library interacts with web elements using XPath.

This project is built using a **keyword-driven approach** for better modularity and reusability.

## How the Project is Structured

- **`Create_Account.robot`**:  
  This is the main test suite I wrote to drive the automation. It uses custom keywords to simulate the account creation process.

- **`Project_Variables.resource`**:  
  Here, I stored all the variables used in the tests, like dynamic data generated by Faker.

- **`Project_Keywords.resource`**:  
  This file contains all the reusable keywords I defined to perform core actions, such as filling out forms or clicking buttons.

## What Youâ€™ll Learn from This Project

1. **Dynamic Data Generation**: Using Faker, I generated unique test data for every run. This ensures that the tests are more robust and realistic.
2. **XPath in Browser Library**: I demonstrated how to effectively use `=` in XPath for locating web elements.
3. **Keyword-Driven Approach**: With reusable keywords, I built a modular test framework that is easy to extend and maintain.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you need the following:

1. **Python** (make sure itâ€™s installed on your system).
2. Install required libraries:
   - Robot Framework:  
     ```bash
     pip install robotframework
     ```
   - Browser Library:  
     ```bash
     pip install robotframework-browser
     ```
   - Faker Library:  
     ```bash
     pip install robotframework-faker
     ```

### Running the Test

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/WaleBade/Robotframework-Browser-Faker-Library-
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the test suite:
   ```bash
   robot Create_Account.robot
   ```

### Test Output

When you execute the test, Robot Framework will generate detailed reports and logs. You can find them in the `/output` folder.
